# JKQtPlotter
This is an extensive library of function/data plotter classes for Qt (>= 4.7, tested with Qt up to 5.4).

This software is licensed under the term of the GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1 
(LGPL 2.1) or above. 

## Examples
You can find usage examples for the classes in this repository in the subfolder "test". All test-projects are Qt-projects that use qmake to build. You can load them into QtCreator easily.

###Parametrized Scatter Plots and Data Viewer
Scatter Plots can have symbols where the shape/color/size is parametrized by a data column. Also the plotter is built around an internal datastore, which you can access (readonly!!!) by a data-viewer that is accessible from the contextmenu in any plot.
